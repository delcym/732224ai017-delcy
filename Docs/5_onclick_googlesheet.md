- Create Workflow: Start by setting up a new workflow in n8n.
- Trigger: "On Form Submission": Set up a trigger node to capture the form submission event. This will start the workflow whenever a form is submitted.
- Action: "Append Row in Sheet": After the form is submitted, the next action is to append the data from the form submission into a Google Sheet.
- In this step, you’ll configure the node to connect to Google Sheets and specify the sheet where the data will be appended.
- Execute Workflow: Once everything is connected, you can execute the workflow to test and run the process whenever a form is submitted.
- The data from the form will automatically be added to the sheet.
